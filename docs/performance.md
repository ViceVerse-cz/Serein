# Notification sound replacement — September 13, 2026

Baseline: `6d9e32222d1e3bd4d4edfd01f30854033788b11f` (synthesized mono cues).
After: embedded owner-supplied MP3 cues, decoded to stereo on the existing worker.

Windows x64, Ryzen 7 7800X3D (16 logical processors), approximately 32 GiB RAM,
Rust 1.98.1. No Cargo builds ran during the recorded timing samples.

| Cue preparation at 48 kHz | Baseline median | After median | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| New message | 0.108364 ms | 0.329464 ms | +0.221100 ms |
| Current channel | 0.103316 ms | 0.264723 ms | +0.161407 ms |
| Incoming ring | 0.343465 ms | 3.877686 ms | +3.534221 ms |

Method: isolated copies of each revision's `samples` function, using the existing
release Symphonia/Opus dependencies for the new decoder; compiled with `rustc -O
-C lto=thin`. One warmup per cue, then five batches of 100 preparations with
`std::hint::black_box`, measured by `Instant`; table shows the median batch time
divided by 100. The incoming ring changes from 0.8 seconds mono to approximately
four seconds stereo, so this is a changed-workload comparison, not a decoder
speed comparison. These timings exclude device startup and playback and do not
measure UI latency, native process CPU/RSS, or live Discord behavior.

The encoded assets total 106,608 bytes. Source decoding and sample-rate conversion
run outside UI/audio callbacks; the callback copies prepared samples and tracks
the final device playback timestamp. Memory ceilings are documented in
[storage-policy.md](storage-policy.md).
