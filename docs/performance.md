# Notification sound replacement — September 13, 2026

Baseline: `6d9e32222d1e3bd4d4edfd01f30854033788b11f` (synthesized mono cues).
After: embedded owner-supplied MP3 cues, decoded to stereo on the existing worker.

Windows x64, Ryzen 7 7800X3D (16 logical processors), approximately 32 GiB RAM,
Rust 1.98.1. No Cargo builds ran during the recorded timing samples.

| Cue preparation at 48 kHz | Baseline median | After median | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| New message | 0.108364 ms | 0.329464 ms | +0.221100 ms |
| Current channel | 0.103316 ms | 0.264723 ms | +0.161407 ms |
| Incoming ring | 0.343465 ms | 3.877686 ms | +3.534221 ms |

Method: isolated copies of each revision's `samples` function, using the existing
release Symphonia/Opus dependencies for the new decoder; compiled with `rustc -O
-C lto=thin`. One warmup per cue, then five batches of 100 preparations with
`std::hint::black_box`, measured by `Instant`; table shows the median batch time
divided by 100. The incoming ring changes from 0.8 seconds mono to approximately
four seconds stereo, so this is a changed-workload comparison, not a decoder
speed comparison. These timings exclude device startup and playback and do not
measure UI latency, native process CPU/RSS, or live Discord behavior.

The encoded assets total 106,608 bytes. Source decoding and sample-rate conversion
run outside UI/audio callbacks; the callback copies prepared samples and tracks
the final device playback timestamp. Memory ceilings are documented in
[storage-policy.md](storage-policy.md).

## Title-strip dragging — September 13, 2026

Baseline: `7eb23fa`, built in a detached worktree. After: the title-strip press handling
and nonselectable caption text from `fix/titlebar-drag`, on that same baseline.
Windows x64, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, approximately 32 GiB RAM, Rust 1.98.1.
Both builds use `cargo xtask package`, including voice, without demo/developer-session features.

| Metric | Baseline | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Executable bytes | 70,288,896 | 70,289,920 | +1,024 (+0.0015%) |
| Installed package bytes | 76,691,365 | 76,692,825 | +1,460 (+0.0019%) |
| ZIP bytes | 44,629,357 | 44,629,786 | +429 (+0.0010%) |

One package per revision; installed size sums files, ZIP uses PowerShell `Compress-Archive`.
Both package file lists match. Sizes were captured before adding this measurement note;
later main integration is outside this comparison. The title strip requests a native drag on the
initial primary-button press instead of waiting for a movement threshold. Synthetic input
tests verify command timing and caption-button isolation, not actual OS movement.
Native CPU, RSS, frame timing and drag latency are unmeasured: native computer-control APIs
are disabled in this session and the Orca CLI is absent. No runtime speed claim is made.

# Empty-channel welcome — September 13, 2026

Baseline: `7eb23fa` with the same new offline empty-channel fixture injected for
the preview only. Both previews were built with
`cargo build --release --locked -p serein --features demo` and launched with
`--demo --demo-empty-channel`. Standard packages exclude that fixture.

Ubuntu 26.04.1 x64, Ryzen 5 7535U (12 logical CPUs), 14 GiB usable RAM,
Rust 1.98.1, eframe/wgpu, default dark palette, 1× scale, 1120×760.
The comparison used an isolated Xvfb 21.1.22 display with hardware presentation
unavailable, rather than the owner's interactive desktop. No builds ran during
sampling. The window was resized to 1120×760 after three seconds, then left
untouched for five more seconds before one ten-second sample (11 readings at
one-second intervals). Both windows were unfocused, with no caret animation.

| Process metric | Baseline | Welcome | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Idle CPU, one core = 100% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0 percentage points |
| Settled RSS | 255,496 KiB | 241,488 KiB | −14,008 KiB (−5.48%) |
| Peak RSS through sample end | 255,496 KiB | 241,488 KiB | −14,008 KiB (−5.48%) |

CPU comes from `/proc/<pid>/stat` user/system tick deltas over the actual sample
duration; no CPU ticks were observed in either idle interval. Settled RSS is the
median of the last five `VmRSS` readings, and peak RSS is `VmHWM`. Neither process
had children; the shared Xvfb server is test infrastructure and is excluded.
Startup/close frame diagnostics showed nine callbacks and zero timeline reflows
for each run. This single pair is noisy and does not establish a memory
improvement or physical-GPU performance. Earlier interactive-desktop samples
were discarded after external input changed the scene. Startup latency and p95
frame latency remain unmeasured. Standard executable/installed/compressed package
sizes are recorded in the task PR, using the built packages.

## Channel shortcut restore - September 13, 2026

Baseline: `a90f0759ada23206809dc5374aef3e472875571a`. After: that revision plus
the shortcut restore fix on `fix/channel-shortcut-restore`. Windows x64,
Ryzen 7 7800X3D (16 logical processors), 31.1 GiB usable RAM, Rust 1.98.1.
Both use `cargo xtask package`, including voice, without demo/developer-session
features, built sequentially in the same worktree with baseline output copied aside.

| Metric | Baseline | After | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Executable bytes | 70,294,016 | 70,294,016 | 0 (0%) |
| Installed package bytes | 76,702,334 | 76,702,726 | +392 (+0.0005%) |
| ZIP bytes | 44,632,436 | 44,632,874 | +438 (+0.0010%) |

One package per revision; installed size sums files, ZIP uses PowerShell
`Compress-Archive`, and package file lists match. Sizes precede this measurement
note. The fix retains one pending restore flag until the existing bounded worker
has queue space, with no timer, worker, queue expansion or database migration.
The synthetic queue/SQLite check verifies recovery after all 16 slots are occupied;
it is not a timing benchmark. Native CPU, RSS and restore latency are unmeasured
because native computer-control APIs are disabled and the Orca CLI is absent.
No runtime speed or memory improvement is claimed.
